## Security

A number of security steps were taken in this project in order to protect the user's submitted data. Unlike a strictly informative website, Creative Star allows the user to become part of the community and interact with the comments. To meet the strict internet standards of protecting a user's data, the following processes were included in the project's development.

### AllAuth  

Django AllAuth is an installable framework that takes care of the user registration and authentication process. Authentication was needed to determine when a user was registered or unregistered and it controlled who could add comments to the posts. The setup of AllAuth included:

- installing it to my workspace dependencies
- adding it to my INSTALLED_APPS in my settings.py
- sourcing the AUTHENTICATION_BACKENDS from the AllAuth docs for my settings.py
- adding its URL to my projects 'urls.py'
- run database migrations to create the tables needed for AllAuth
  
## Features

## User View - Registered/Unregistered

It was important to me from the beginning that Creative Star be accessible to an unregistered user, in some capacity. I wanted the website to sell the idea of using About to a new user quickly by immediately inviting them into the community through the Uploads and comments sections. The following is a breakdown of the site's accessibility for registered/unregistered users:

| Feature | Unregistered User | Registered, Logged-In User |
|-----------|-------------------|-----------------|
| About page | Visible | Visible |
| Uplosd Images | Not visable | Visible |
| Comments | Not visable | Visible with full feature interaction |

## Deployment

### Connecting to Github

To begin this project from scratch, you must first create a new GitHub repository using the [Code Institute's Template](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Org/ci-full-template). This template provides the relevant tools to get you started. To use this template:

1. Log in to [GitHub](https://github.com/) or create a new account.
2. Navigate to the above CI Full Template.
3. Click '**Use this template**' -> '**Create a new repository**'.
4. Choose a new repository name and click '**Create repository from template**'.
5. In your new repository space, click the green Open button to generate a new workspace.

## Django Project Setup

1. Install Django and supporting libraries: 
   
- ```pip3 install 'django4' gunicorn```
- ```pip3 install dj_database_url psycopg2```
- ```pip3 install dj3-cloudinary-storage```  
  
2. Once you have installed any relevant dependencies or libraries, such as the ones listed above, it is important to create a **requirements.txt** file and add all installed libraries to it with the ```pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt``` command in the terminal.  
3. Create a new Django project in the terminal ```django-admin startproject config .```
4. Create a new app eg. ```python3 mangage.py startapp blog```
5. Add this to list of **INSTALLED_APPS** in **settings.py** - 'blog',
6. Create a superuser for the project to allow Admin access and enter credentials: ```python3 manage.py createsuperuser```
7. Migrate the changes with commands: ```python3 manage.py migrate```
8. An **env.py** file must be created to store all protected data such as the **DATABASE_URL** and **SECRET_KEY**. These may be called upon in your project's **settings.py** file along with your Database configurations. The **env.py** file must be added to your **gitignore** file so that your important, protected information is not pushed to public viewing on GitHub. For adding to **env.py**:

- ```import os```
- ```os.environ["DATABASE_URL"]="<URL_supplied_by_Code_Institute>"```
- ```os.environ["SECRET_KEY"]="<my_secret_key>"```
  
For adding to **settings.py**:

- ```import os```
- ```import dj_database_url```
- ```if os.path.exists("env.py"):```
- ```import env```
- ```SECRET_KEY = os.environ.get('SECRET_KEY')``` (actual key hidden within env.py)  

9. Replace **DATABASES** with:

```
DATABASES = {
    'default': dj_database_url.parse(os.environ.get("DATABASE_URL"))
  }
```
10. Set up the templates directory in **settings.py**:
- Under ``BASE_DIR`` enter ``TEMPLATES_DIR = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, ‘templates’)``
- Update ``TEMPLATES = 'DIRS': [TEMPLATES_DIR]`` with:

```
os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'templates'),
os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'templates', 'allauth')
```

- Create the static and templates directories in top level of project file in IDE workspace.

11. A **Procfile** must be created within the project repo for Heroku deployment with the following placed within it: ```web: gunicorn config.wsgi```
12. Make the necessary migrations again.

## Cloudinary API 

Cloudinary provides a cloud hosting solution for media storage. All uploaded images in the Happy Heath website are hosted here.

Set up a new account at [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/) and add your Cloudinary API environment variable to your **env.py** and Heroku Config Vars.
In your project workspace: 

- Add Cloudinary libraries to INSTALLED_APPS in settings.py 
- In the order: 
```
   'cloudinary_storage',  
   'django.contrib.staticfiles',  
   'cloudinary',
```
- Add to **env.py** and link up with **settings.py**: ```os.environ["CLOUDINARY_URL"]="cloudinary://<api_key>"``` 
- Set Cloudinary as storage for images in settings.py:
- ```STATIC_URL = '/static/'```
```
  STATICFILES_DIRS = [os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'static'), ]  
  STATIC_ROOT = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'staticfiles')‌  
```
## PostgreSQL from Code Institute

1. Navigate to [PostgreSQL from Code Institute](https://dbs.ci-dbs.net/).
2. Enter your student email address and click submit. Wait whilst the database is created. When done an emial will be sent to your student email address.
3. Review the email which will contain a URL to connect to your new database.
4. Copy the database URL and place within your **DATABASE_URL**  in your **env.py** file and follow the below instructions to place it in your Heroku Config Vars. 

## Heroku deployment

To start the deployment process , please follow the below steps:

1. Log in to [Heroku](https://id.heroku.com/login) or create an account if you are a new user.
2. Once logged in, in the Heroku Dashboard, navigate to the '**New**' button in the top, right corner, and select '**Create New App**'.
3. Enter an app name and choose your region. Click '**Create App**'. 
4. In the Deploy tab, click on the '**Settings**', reach the '**Config Vars**' section and click on '**Reveal Config Vars**'. Here you will enter KEY:VALUE pairs for the app to run successfully. The KEY:VALUE pairs that you will need are your: 
   
   - **CLOUDINARY_URL**: **cloudinary://....** 
   - **DATABASE_URL**:**postgres://...** 
   - **DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC** of value '1' (N.B Remove this Config Var before deployment),
   -  **SECRET_KEY** and value  
  
5. Add the Heroku host name into **ALLOWED_HOSTS** in your projects **settings.py file** -> ```['.herokuapp.com].```
6. Once you are sure that you have set up the required files including your requirements.txt and Procfile, you have ensured that **DEBUG=False**, save your project, add the files, commit for initial deployment and push the data to GitHub.
7. Go to the '**Deploy**' tab and choose GitHub as the Deployment method.
8. Search for the repository name, select the branch that you would like to build from, and connect it via the '**Connect**' button.
9.  Choose from '**Automatic**' or '**Manual**' deployment options, I chose the 'Manual' deployment method. Click '**Deploy Branch**'.
10. Once the waiting period for the app to build has finished, click the '**View**' link to bring you to your newly deployed site. If you receive any errors, Heroku will display a reason in the app build log for you to investigate. **DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC**  may be removed from the Config Vars once you have static/css, static/images, or static/js files.
